# ToDo
* If Invoke is not implemented explicitly (not via inheritance) on the subcommand, report an error.

# Discuss
* Where do we put the dynamic suggestions delegate?
* How do we handle arity where the argument is optional but the value for the argument is not optional (See Type property on ListCommand)
* What happens if the developer forgets to derive command or the base command?
* Do we need to handle a subcomand (ie --install) that occurs for multiple subcommands.

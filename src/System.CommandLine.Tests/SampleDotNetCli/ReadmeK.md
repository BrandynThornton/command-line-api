This should be merged into the readme for this work, but is separate to avoid merge conflicts as we collect ideas.

Fundamental questions:

- composition or inheritance to define relationships
  - inheritance prohibits the use of abstract to indicate not-invokable 
  - **inhertance allows final command to be a natural conflating of data regardless of structure


- Attributes
  - Combining attributes offers better IntelliSense guidance
